{% hint style="info" %}
With **port mapping**, you can now access the Jenkins server at `http://localhost:8080`.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Suppose you log in to the Jenkins server and make some configuration changes. If you then spin up another container and access the Jenkins server there, you won't see the configuration changes made in the first container. This happens because these are two isolated environments, and the data from the first container is not shared with the second one.

To resolve this issue, you can use **volume mapping**. By mapping the data volumes of both containers to the same directory on the Docker host, the configurations and data will be shared between them. This ensures that changes made in one container are accessible in the other.
