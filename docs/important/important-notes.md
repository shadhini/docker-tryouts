# Important Notes

## Alive Period of Containers

{% hint style="success" %}
**Containers are designed to run specific tasks or processes**,&#x20;

not to host an entire operating system like virtual machines.



A **container** only **exists** **as long as the process inside it is running** (i.e. alive).&#x20;

Once the task is complete or the service stops, the container exits.
{% endhint %}



{% hint style="info" %}
When you run a Docker container from an **Ubuntu image** using the `docker run ubuntu` command,&#x20;

‚ï∞**---**‚û§ **the container starts and exits immediately**.&#x20;



Ubuntu is an image of an OS that is used as the base image for other applications.

Thus, the container runs its default command (usually a shell), completes it, and then stops.&#x20;

As a result, it doesn't appear in the list of running containers but can be found in the list of all containers, marked as "exited."

## Accessing Services on Docker Host from a Docker Container

{% hint style="success" %}
Use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` to access a service running on the docker host from the docker container. This special DNS name resolves to the host machine's IP from within the container.
