# Container Orchestration

## Why Orchestrate?

When the number of users increases beyond what a single instance can handle, you must manually deploy additional instances of your application.&#x20;

â•°**--**âž¤ This requires closely **monitoring the load, performance, and health** of your containers.&#x20;

* If a **container fails**,&#x20;
  * you must detect the failure and redeploy it.&#x20;
* If the Docker **host crashes**,&#x20;
  * all its containers become inaccessible, requiring further intervention.

Monitoring and managing large-scale applications with thousands of containers manually or through custom scripts is impractical.&#x20;

â•°**--**âž¤ **Container orchestration** solves these challenges by **automating deployment, scaling, health monitoring, and recovery**.



## Container Orchestration

> **Container orchestration solutions:**
>
> provide tools and scripts to manage containers in production environments

&#x20;&#x20;

* typically, consist of **multiple Docker hosts** to ensure application availability even if one host fails.&#x20;
* enable the **deployment of** hundreds or **thousands of** application **instances** with a single command.&#x20;

#### Features:

* **automatic scaling** of instances based on user demand
* **adding additional hosts** to handle load
* **advanced networking** across hosts
* **load balancing**
* **shared storage**
* **configuration management**
* **security**
